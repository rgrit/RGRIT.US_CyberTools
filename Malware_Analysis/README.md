### 🔍 **Why Malware Analysis Matters**
Malware is constantly evolving, and **threat intelligence teams need robust tools** to detect, analyze, and mitigate these threats. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**—such as **file hashes, malicious URLs, domains, and IP addresses**—help identify infected systems, trace attack origins, and prevent future breaches.  

This toolkit **streamlines the process** by leveraging **VirusTotal**, a global threat intelligence database, to **automate IOC validation**, enabling faster and more efficient threat detection.

## 🔍 **VirusTotal IOC Scanning**  

| 🛠️ **Script** | 📌 **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `virus_total_scan.py` | 🔎 Queries VirusTotal for file hashes and reports malicious indicators. |

### **🔹 Key Features**  
✅ **Batch IOC Scanning** – Reads a list of IoCs (hashes, URLs, domains) from a CSV and checks them against VirusTotal.  
✅ **Automated Reports** – Outputs flagged threats in a structured CSV format for further analysis.  
✅ **Threat Intelligence Integration** – Enhances security operations by cross-referencing known threats.  
✅ **Rate Limit Handling** – Ensures compliance with VirusTotal API restrictions for seamless execution.

## 📌 **Usage Guide**  

### **Step 1: Set Up Your VirusTotal API Key**  
1. **Sign up** at [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to get an API key.  
2. Create a file named `virustotal_api_key.txt` in the same directory as the script.  
3. Paste your **API key** inside the file.  

### **Step 2: Prepare an IOC List**  
1. **Create a CSV file** (e.g., `ioc_list.csv`).  
2. List **one IOC per line** (hash, domain, URL, or IP). Example:  
   ```
   d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
   hxxp://malicious-site.com
   192.168.1.100
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Scanner**  
Execute the script to **query VirusTotal and analyze IOCs**:  
```bash
python virus_total_scan.py
```

### **Step 4: Review the Results**  
- Output will be saved in **`flagged_iocs.csv`**, providing insights into detected threats.  
- Use these results for **further investigation, network security updates, and proactive defense**.
