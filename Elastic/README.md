# Elasticsearch API Interactions Repository

**A Collection of Secure Python Scripts for Interacting with Elasticsearch APIs**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to interact with various Elasticsearch APIs. These scripts facilitate monitoring, querying, and managing Elasticsearch clusters securely and efficiently.

The first feature in this repository is a **Cluster Health Checker**, which connects to an Elasticsearch cluster over HTTPS, authenticates securely, verifies certificates, and retrieves cluster health status. Additional scripts for querying indices, managing data, and automating administrative tasks will be included in future updates.

---

## Key Features

- **Secure API Interactions:**  
  All scripts use HTTPS to ensure encrypted data transmission.

- **Authentication Support:**  
  Uses basic authentication with Elasticsearch credentials for secure access.

- **Certificate Validation:**  
  Supports CA certificate verification to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

- **Timeout Handling:**  
  Ensures operations do not hang indefinitely by implementing request timeouts.

- **Modular & Scalable:**  
  Scripts are designed to be modular, making it easy to add new API interactions.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3:**  
  Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.

- **Elasticsearch Python Client:**  
  Install the official client using:
  ```bash
  pip install elasticsearch
  ```

- **Elasticsearch Cluster Access:**  
  Ensure that your Elasticsearch cluster is accessible via HTTPS.

- **CA Certificate:**  
  A valid CA certificate file (e.g., `/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt`) to verify the serverâ€™s authenticity.

---

## Available Scripts

### 1. Cluster Health Checker
- Retrieves the health status of an Elasticsearch cluster.
- Ensures a secure connection using authentication and certificate validation.
- Example output:
  ```
  Elasticsearch Cluster Health: {'cluster_name': 'your_cluster', 'status': 'green', ...}
  ```

#### Usage:
```bash
python3 elasticsearch_health_checker.py
```

### More Scripts Coming Soon...
- **Index Querying:** Retrieve documents, search indices, and filter data.
- **Data Management:** Automate data ingestion, deletion, and updates.
- **Security & Role Management:** Manage users, roles, and permissions.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Gather detailed cluster and node statistics.

---

## Example Code (Cluster Health Checker)
```python
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

# Configure the Elasticsearch client
es = Elasticsearch(
    ["https://<<YOUR URL>>:9200"],  # Ensure it's HTTPS
    basic_auth=("<<YOUR USERNAME>>", "<<YOUR PASSWORD>>"),
    ca_certs="/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt"  # Path to the CA certificate
)

try:
    health = es.options(request_timeout=30).cluster.health()
    print("Elasticsearch Cluster Health:", health)
except Exception as e:
    print("Error connecting to Elasticsearch:", e)
```

---

## Future Features

Planned enhancements for this repository include:

- **Automated Alerting:**  
  Notify administrators via email, Slack, or webhooks when cluster health degrades.

- **Index & Query Analytics:**  
  Track query performance and optimize index structures.

- **Logging & Audit Trails:**  
  Maintain a history of executed API calls for security compliance.

- **Automated Scaling & Resource Management:**  
  Monitor and optimize cluster resource usage dynamically.
