# Ducky Script Automation & Linux Recon & Cleanup Toolkit

_A Comprehensive Suite for Automated Payload Conversion and System Reconnaissance_

---

## Overview

This repository provides a two-fold solution for enhancing your cybersecurity toolset:

1. **Ducky Script Automation:**  
   A Python-based utility to automatically encode Ducky scripts (plain-text `.txt` files) into binary payloads using a Java encoder (`encoder.jar`).

2. **Linux Recon & Cleanup Ducky Script:**  
   An example Ducky script that performs extensive system reconnaissance on Linux hosts. It gathers system information, network details, process lists, installed packages, and USB device data. The script then archives the collected data and securely cleans up any traces.

These tools were developed with a purple team mindset, demonstrating both offensive simulation and defensive detection techniques. They enable rapid payload conversion and help simulate real-world reconnaissance scenarios.

## Repository Contents

- **encode_ducky_scripts.py**  
  A Python script that:
  - Scans a specified directory for all `.txt` Ducky script files.
  - Uses the Java-based `encoder.jar` to convert each script into a binary payload.
  - Outputs the resulting `.bin` files in the same directory.

- **encoder.jar**  
  The Java application required to encode Ducky scripts.  
  _Note: Ensure that this file exists in the repository; if missing, please download it as per instructions._

- **Ducky_Scripts/**  
  A directory containing:
  - **Sample Ducky Script Files (.txt):**  
    Example payloads including `linux_recon_and_cleanup.txt` that collects and cleans up system reconnaissance data.
  - **Converted Binary Payloads (.bin):**  
    The output generated by the Python script after encoding.

- **sample_logs.txt** (Optional)  
  Example log entries generated during the execution of the Linux recon script—useful for validating detection rules and security monitoring.

- **README.md**  
  This document – providing an executive-level overview, instructions, and the strategic value of these tools.

## How It Works

### Ducky Script Automation
- **Purpose:** Automate the conversion of human-readable Ducky scripts to binary payloads ready for deployment.
- **Process:**  
  1. The Python script scans the `Ducky_Scripts` directory for `.txt` files.
  2. For each file, it runs a Java command invoking `encoder.jar` to create a corresponding `.bin` file.
  3. Success and error messages are printed to provide clear status feedback.

### Linux Recon & Cleanup Ducky Script
- **Purpose:** Execute a series of commands on a target Linux machine to:
  - Gather system information (kernel details, distribution, OS release).
  - Capture user & group details, active network connections, running processes, installed packages, and USB device information.
  - Archive the collected data and perform self-cleanup to remove traces.
- **Workflow in the Script:**
  - **Launch Terminal:** Opens a new terminal session.
  - **Create Workspace:** Sets up a temporary directory `/tmp/recon` for data collection.
  - **Data Collection:** Executes multiple commands to capture system info, network details, etc.
  - **Data Archiving:** Archives the contents of `/tmp/recon` into `/tmp/recon_data.tar`.
  - **Cleanup:** Securely removes the temporary directory and archive, and clears command history before exiting.

## Strategic Value

- **Automation & Efficiency:**  
  Streamlines the process of converting Ducky scripts into deployable payloads, reducing manual overhead.

- **Enhanced Reconnaissance:**  
  The Linux recon script simulates an adversary’s data-gathering steps, providing valuable insights into USB and system activity that can inform defensive monitoring and detection strategies.

- **Purple Team Demonstration:**  
  By showcasing both the offensive (payload conversion and deployment) and defensive (log analysis and rule creation) sides, this toolkit illustrates a proactive, comprehensive approach to cybersecurity.

## Prerequisites & Setup

- **Java:**  
  Ensure Java is installed on your system to run `encoder.jar`.

- **Python 3:**  
  Required to execute the encoding script.

- **Directory Structure:**  
  Maintain the provided directory structure (with the `Ducky_Scripts` folder in place) for the scripts to locate input files and output the encoded payloads.

- **Usage:**  
  1. **Run the Python Encoder:**
     ```bash
     python3 encode_ducky_scripts.py
     ```
     This command processes all `.txt` files in the `Ducky_Scripts` directory and produces `.bin` payloads.
  
  2. **Deploy the Ducky Script:**  
     Load the sample Ducky script (or your own) onto your device to execute the Linux recon and cleanup operations on a target system.
