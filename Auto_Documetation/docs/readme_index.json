This includes sections for recent updates, repository overview, and detailed listings of scripts by directory.\n5. **Saves README and History**: Finally, it saves the generated README content to a specified location within the repository and updates the history file with the current state of descriptions.\n\nTo address your request for a \"description,\" I'll provide an overview that could serve as a concise summary or abstract of the script's functionality:\n\n**Script Overview**\n\nThis script automates the generation and maintenance of a GitHub repository's README file.

  "Network_Security/network_monitoring/sniffer.py": "The provided code appears to be a part of a network packet capture tool. It's written in Python and utilizes the Scapy library for packet capture and manipulation. Here's a breakdown of the code:\n\n**Packet Capture Functionality**\n\n1. The code initializes several variables, including `capture_running`, `capture_start_time`, `capture_duration`, and others.\n2. It defines a function to log messages (`log_callback`) and another to update the progress bar (`update_progress`).\n3. The main packet capture functionality is implemented in an unnamed function ( likely a callback or event handler). This function:\n\t* Captures packets using Scapy's `sniff()` function.\n\t* Analyzes the captured packets, extracting various statistics such as TCP, UDP, ICMP, and ARP packet counts.\n\t* Checks for unusual network activity based on predefined thresholds (e.g., high packet rates, unusual protocol usage).\n\t* Logs the results, including any detected unusual activity.\n\t* Saves the captured packets to a PCAP file using Scapy's `wrpcap()` function.\n\n**Progress Updates and Countdown**\n\n1. The `update_progress()` function updates the countdown label and progress bar based on the elapsed time since the capture started.\n2. It calculates the remaining time, progress percentage, and updates the GUI components accordingly.\n3. The function schedules itself to be called again after a 1-second delay using the `root.after()` method.\n\n**GUI Integration**\n\nThe code seems to be integrated with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using a library like Tkinter (given the presence of `root`, `countdown_label`, and `progress_bar` variables). The GUI likely provides a countdown timer, progress bar, and possibly other controls for starting and stopping the packet capture.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The code is truncated, so some parts might be missing.\n* There are no error handling mechanisms in place, which could lead to issues if something goes wrong during packet capture or analysis.\n* Some variables (e.g., `pcap_filename`, `threshold`) seem to be defined elsewhere in the codebase, as they are not initialized in this snippet.\n\nTo write similar code, you would need to:\n\n1. Import necessary libraries (Scapy, Tkinter, etc.).\n2. Initialize variables and set up the GUI components.\n3. Implement the packet capture functionality using Scapy's `sniff()` function.\n4. Analyze the captured packets and extract relevant statistics.\n5. Update the GUI with progress information and detected unusual activity.\n6. Save the captured packets to a PCAP file.\n\nHere is an example of how you might structure your code:\n```python\nimport scapy.all as scapy\nimport tkinter as tk\n\nclass PacketCaptureTool:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.capture_running = False\n        self.capture_start_time = None\n        self.capture_duration = 0\n        self.pcap_filename = \"capture.pcap\"\n\n        # Set up GUI components\n        self.root = tk.Tk()\n        self.countdown_label = tk.Label(self.root, text=\"Remaining time: \")\n        self.progress_bar = tk.Progressbar(self.root)\n\n    def start_capture(self):\n        # Start packet capture using Scapy's sniff() function\n        scapy.sniff(prn=self.packet_callback, timeout=self.capture_duration)\n\n    def packet_callback(self, packet):\n        # Analyze the captured packet and update statistics\n        if packet.haslayer(scapy.TCP):\n            self.tcp_count += 1\n        elif packet.haslayer(scapy.UDP):\n            self.udp_count += 1\n        # ...\n\n    def update_progress(self):\n        # Update countdown label and progress bar\n        elapsed = time.time() - self.capture_start_time\n        remaining = max(0, self.capture_duration - elapsed)\n        progress_percentage = min(100, (elapsed / self.capture_duration) * 100)\n        self.countdown_label.config(text=f\"Remaining time: {remaining:.0f} sec\")\n        self.progress_bar['value'] = progress_percentage\n\n    def save_capture(self):\n        # Save captured packets to a PCAP file\n        scapy.wrpcap(self.pcap_filename, self.packets)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    tool = PacketCaptureTool()\n    tool.start_capture()\n    tool.root.mainloop()\n```\nNote that this is a simplified example and you will likely need to add more functionality, error handling, and customization to suit your specific requirements.",
  "Network_Security/wireless_security/WiFi_Discover/wifi_packet_sniff.py": "This is a Python script that appears to be designed for WiFi packet sniffing and analysis. It uses the Scapy library to capture and analyze WiFi packets, and then generates a Markdown report based on the captured data.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what the script does:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The script starts by importing necessary libraries, including Scapy and setting up some constants.\n2. **Packet Capture**: The script captures WiFi packets using Scapy's `sniff` function, filtering out packets that don't contain a Dot11 layer (which is the layer for WiFi packets).\n3. **Packet Analysis**: For each captured packet, the script checks if it's a management frame (type 0), control frame (type 1), or data frame (type 2). It then tallies the counts of each type.\n4. **Network Discovery**: If the packet is a beacon or probe response, the script extracts the SSID, BSSID, encryption type, channel, and signal strength (if available).\n5. **Client Detection**: The script tries to detect client connections by checking if the transmitter or receiver address is a known BSSID and the other address is unicast.\n6. **Report Generation**: The script generates a Markdown report based on the captured data, including:\n\t* A summary of the capture duration and total packets captured.\n\t* A breakdown of management, control, and data frames.\n\t* A table of discovered networks, including SSID, BSSID, channel, encryption type, average signal strength, and associated clients.\n7. **Next Steps**: The script also generates example commands for deauthenticating or jamming each discovered network (using external scripts `wifi_deauth.py` and `wifi_jam.py`, which are not included in this code snippet).\n\nSome notes on the code:\n\n* The script assumes that the WiFi interface is already configured to monitor mode.\n* The script uses a simple threshold-based approach to detect client connections, which may not be accurate in all cases.\n* The script generates example commands for deauthenticating or jamming networks, but these should only be used for educational purposes and with proper authorization.\n\nOverall, this script appears to be designed for educational purposes or for use in a controlled environment, rather than for malicious activities.",
